# ML-DPO FOR CYANO-SUBSTITUTED POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBON (PAH)
## DATA

Refer to total\_data.csv.   
total\_data.csv are generated by pooling everything in CyanoDATA. 
Files in CyanoDATA are NOT used in the research. 

## GENERATING PREDICTIONS OR TRAIN MODEL

run file main.py. See https://github.com/Tuan-H-Nguyen/Machine-Learning-Degree-Pi-Orbital for details how to run.

## OTHERS

main\_plot.py for replicating some the plots and results in the paper such as 
- plots of electronic properties vs DPO or SDPO
- plots of QSPR prediction and DFT computed for three electronic properties
- 10-runs-average RMSDs

vs\_train\_set\_size.py for replicating plot of RMSD as a function of training set sizes.

Modified ML-DPO and modified training flow can be found in gd\_dpo/modGD\_DPO.py and trainer.py
